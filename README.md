# csgo-level-generator
A script that generates a .vmf file for CS:GO to compile and play.

To generate a level:

1.) Download all of the text files along with the python script.

2.) Put all of the files you've downloaded in its own folder.

3.) Run the script and you should get a .vmf file to open in the Hammer editor to compile.
